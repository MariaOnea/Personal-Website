# Personal-Website
This project is a personal website, in which I used elementary concepts of HTML and CSS. It has helped me understand how to create a web site efficiently and it has also given me the opportunity to utilize my creativity and resourcefulness.

The purpose of this website is to inform the user about me and my personal work. It consists of 4 pages: Home, About, Portofolio and Contact.

The "Home" page contains some general details about me, such as where I study and what I am passionate about.
The "About" page has info regarding my education, hobbies, certificates and skills.

The "Portofolio" page has some of my work, most of it being projects I made with Adobe Photoshop.

Finally, the "Contact" page features a Contact Form that redirects the user to the Mail app, providing my email as the recipient. This page is made rudimentary, because it has several fields that can be filled in, but the information written in them is not saved.
